# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code
**Introduction**
Hello! Welcome to my "Work Day Scheduler," a daily planner that changes dynamically througout the day. Enter your dailys tasks according to the hours they need to be completed by, & then click the blue "SAVE" button. This project utilizes localStorage to save these tasks & will persist after refreshing the page. Utilizing Moment.JS, we also have the ability to color-code tasks. Red tasks occur in the current hour, while gray tasks occurred in the past & green ones in the future.

**Code & Resources Utilized**
This project was completed utilizing HTML, CSS, & Javascript, and also made use of the third party API's JQuery, Moment.JS & Bootstrap.

**Acknowledgments**
As always, I must thank the team of tutors & TA's that help me every day to get stronger in coding, as well as the teams of coders that created all the third party API's utlized here.
